# My kingdom for a template

![Import button](../img/SUPPLIER_Products_ProductGrid_focus.png)

In order to have an easy way to import your products in your Onboarder, you can download a template matching your families. Those templates provide all the attributes in a format that your Onboarder will accept.

Here is how to get them:
1. Log in your `Supplier Onboarder`
1. Click on the `Download` icon on the top right corner of the product grid
1. Choose your preferred format: one file per family or one file with all families, in `CSV` or `XLSX`

This template file can easily be imported in your Onboarder to add many products at once.
