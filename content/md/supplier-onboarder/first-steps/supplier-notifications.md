# When are you notified?

![notifications](../img/notifications.svg)

As a supplier, you'll notified by email twice a week.

On the top of this email you'll find the status of all the products you have in your Onboarder :
* `To enrich`: all the new or existing products that are not completed yet,
* `Approved`: all the products accepted by the retailer / distributor,
* `Rejected`: all the products rejected by the retailer / distributor.

Then in the middle, you'll find the same statuses for the products you completed since last email.
