# When are you notified?

![notifications](../img/notifications.svg)

As a supplier, you'll notified by email twice a week.

On the top of this email you'll find the status of all the products you have in your Onboarder :
* `To enrich`: all the new or existing products that are not completed yet,
* `Rejected`: all the products rejected by the retailer / distributor,
* `Approved`: all the products accepted by the retailer / distributor.


Then in the body of the message tells you the number of approved, rejected and new products to enrich since the last email.
You can click on on numbers or buttons to access to the Onboarder with the related products.
