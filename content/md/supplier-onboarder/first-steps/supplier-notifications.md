# When are you notified?

![notifications](../img/notifications.svg)

As a supplier, you'll be notified by email twice a week.

In this email you'll find the count of all products with the following statuses:
* `To enrich`: all the new or existing products that are not completed yet,
* `Rejected`: all the products rejected by the retailer or distributor,

<!--
Then in the body of the message tells you the number of approved, rejected and new products to enrich since the last email.
-->

You can click on on numbers or buttons to access to the Onboarder with the related products.
