# The Supplier Onboarder? What's that?

The Supplier Onboarder is a dedicated platform for the suppliers which will allow you to enrich the product information your retailer need. It will also be possible to suggest new products.

The Supplier Onboarder is a part of a complete solution, composed of 3 modules:
- the PIM
- the Retailer Onboarder
- the Supplier Onboarder

Your retailer will give you access to your own Onboarder. As soon as your account is activated, you will receive an email with all the information to access your Onboarder.
