# Product creation? Piece of cake!

In order to create a new product on the Onboarder, you just have to:
1. Click on the `Products` menu
1. Click on the `Create` button in the top right corner of the product grid. A creation wizard appears.
1. Specify the unique product identifier (SKU)
1. Fill out the name of the product (optional)
1. Select a family for the new product
1. Hit `Save`.

Your product is now created and its form is displayed. You can start filling its attributes.

:::info
Contrary to the PIM, a product cannot be created without a family. As you don't have access to the attributes' selection, the choice of the family allows you to automatically gain access to all the required attributes of your product.
