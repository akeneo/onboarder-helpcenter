## Complete products
Your Supplier Onboarder allows you to enrich product information. Your retailer gave you access to the products on which he needs information.

:::info
As soon as a product is complete, it will automatically be sent to the retailer without any action from your side.

You just have to focus on filling out the required information, we take care of the rest!
:::


The completeness of your product is always displayed on the Product Form header. You can, at any time, easily retrieve the status of your product.
