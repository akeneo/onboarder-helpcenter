You can use `CSV` or `XLSX` files to import suppliers users. The expected header of your supplier users import file is the following:

Here are the steps to create suppliers users via import:

1. Log in your Retailer Onboarder
1. Click on `Suppliers` then on `Users`
1. Select `CSV` or `XLSX`
1. Click on `Upload a file`
1. Drag your file in the drop area or browse disk
1. Click on `Upload and import now`
1. The process tracker page is prompted. You can follow the progress of the import

When it is finished your suppliers are created and displayed in the users grid
