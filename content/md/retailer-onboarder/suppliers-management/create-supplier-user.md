# Enjoying flat files?

You can use `CSV` or `XLSX` files to import suppliers contacts. The expected header of your supplier contacts import file is the following:
* email: supplier referent email (required)
* last_name: supplier contact's last name (required)
* first_name: supplier contact's first name (required)
* phone: supplier contact's phone number

Here are the steps to create suppliers contacts via import:

1. Log in your Retailer Onboarder
1. Click on `Suppliers` then on `Contacts`
1. Select `CSV` or `XLSX`
1. Click on `Upload a file`
1. Drag your file in the drop area or browse disk
1. Click on `Upload and import now`
1. The process tracker page is prompted. You can follow the progress of the import

When it is finished your suppliers are created and displayed in the contacts grid
