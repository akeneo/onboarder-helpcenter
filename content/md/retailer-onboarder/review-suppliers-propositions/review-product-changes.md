# How to manage suppliers proposals?

When product is completed on the Supplier Onboarder (ie [all attributes defined as required for the channel Onboarder](/onboarder/articles/define-product-requirements.html) are filled in by the supplier), it is sent as a proposal to your PIMso that you can review it.

:::info
A product updated by one of your supplier will never impact directly your PIM. A review step is mandatory so that you can evaluate the proposition.
:::

You can review the suggestions made by suppliers in the [PIM proposals](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/review-products-proposals.html).

## Product models
[Product models with variants](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/what-about-products-variants.html) are specific type of products you can receive proposals for.
You can receive proposals in two different cases :
1. for the product model values
1. for the product variant values

For the product model values, you receive a proposal:
* the first time the supplier completes a product variant with its parents product models,
* and then each time a product model is updated.

For the product variant values, you receive a proposal each time a supplier complete or update a product variant.

## Assets
New assets suggested by suppliers are included in the proposals and they are automatically added to the right asset collection when the new product is accepted.
You can [change the asset](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/manage-asset-families.html) (label, other attributes).
