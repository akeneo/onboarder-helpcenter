# Display prereferenced product list

The supplier has the ability to create prereferenced products, nice, but what is it? A prereferenced product is a product created in the Supplier Onboarder by one of your supplier. These new products can be interesting for you to enlarge your product range or to launch a new collection.

You can easily display them by following these steps:
1. Log in your Retailer Onboarder
1. Click on Product data / New products

A new screen will be prompted with all the prereferenced products.
