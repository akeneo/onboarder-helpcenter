# Privacy Policy for the Use of Ethn.io in Akeneo SaaS Products

Akeneo is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and their data. In this policy, we will explain how we collect, use, and protect personal data when using the Ethn.io tool as part of our SaaS products.

## Collection of Personal Data

We collect personal data through the use of Ethn.io for research purposes. The data we collect includes the company name of the participant, the participant's email address, and the participant's first and last name. We use this data to:

- Understand the context of the participant/customer before an interview by linking it with our CRM.
- Contact the participant for the purpose of scheduling an interview
- Reserve a slot in Google Calendar for the interview
- Address the participant by name in email communications and during the interview
- Enrich our user panel

## Data Retention

We will retain the collected personal data for a period of 5 years. This retention period may be extended if the research project is still ongoing.
