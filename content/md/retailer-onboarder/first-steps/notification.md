# When are you notified?

![notifications](onboarder-helpcenter/content/img/notifications.svg)

As soon as a product is 100% complete in the Supplier Onboarder, it is automatically sent to your Retailer Onboarder. In the meantime, you will be notified that you have proposals to review via the notification center.

Then you can start review them and leverage your product information quality :).
