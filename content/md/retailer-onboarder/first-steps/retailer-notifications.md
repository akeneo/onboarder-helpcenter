# When are you notified?

![notifications](../img/notifications.svg)

You can get two different types of notifications from Akeneo Onboarder.

## New product suggestions
The first one is when the supplier creates a new product and when s/he completes all required attributes of the product, then the product status is updated to `Waiting for approval`. In that case, you can go to the `Product Data` page of the Retailer Onboarder to accept or reject the new product suggestions.

## Enrichment proposals
When you assign a product to a supplier, they can enrich it. Then in the Supplier Onboarder, suppliers see the product as `To enrich`. Once the supplier completes all required attributes of the product, its status changes to `Waiting for approval`. The product is automatically sent to your PIM, and you'll be notified that you have a proposal to review via the notification center.

::: info
Only the PIM users linked to the supplier receive the notifications in both cases.
