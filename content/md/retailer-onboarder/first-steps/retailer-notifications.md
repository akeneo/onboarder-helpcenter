# When are you notified?

![notifications](../img/notifications.svg)

You can get 2 different types of notifications from the Onboarder.

## New product suggestions
The first one is when the supplier creates a new product and as soon as it is marked as `complete`. In that case, you can go in the `Product Data` page into the Retailer Onboarder to accept or reject the new product suggestions.

## Enrichment proposals
When you assign a product to a supplier, they are able to enrich it. Then, as soon as a product is 100% complete in the Supplier Onboarder, it is automatically sent to your PIM and you'll be notified that you have proposals to review via the notification center.

::: info
In both cases, only the PIM users linked to the supplier receive the notifications.
